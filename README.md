# confluence-markup-mode

This is an Emacs Lisp library that provides syntax highlighting for
(old skool)
[Confluence wiki markup](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-wiki-markup-251003035.html),
which is also used in JIRA.

This is based on the
[confluence-el](https://sourceforge.net/projects/confluence-el), a
full-featured package with the ability to edit Confluence wiki pages
over the network.  It's now a simple syntax highlighter.  All
network-facing functionality has been removed.
